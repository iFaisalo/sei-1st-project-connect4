# Connect 4 project ..

the project about coding a Connect 4 Classic Game ..

- index.html
- gamePage.html
  * all created with HTML elements ..
  * styled using CSS style sheet ..
  * jQuery library link added to head ..


- game logic:
  * I didn't know from where to start ..
  but with a lot **a lot** of searching, reading and supporting ..
  _Mr. Saad, Ms. Samar, Ms. Sara, and Mr. Abdullah_
  thank you for your support.
  during search processes I was looking for understandable way for me to 
  code the game accordingly finally I found a tutorial in YouTube and I follow it.

- script:
  * (connect4.js) created to declare a class to use it in (main.js) file ..
  both script files was linked in head tag in the HTML file ..

- presentation:
  * during the presentation, Mr. Saad asked me regarding a specific code line
  > const this = that
  
  my answer was ’that's what youtube guy said’ I said.
  so now here's the right answer:
    * for changing the scope of “this” inside a function within a function ..

  after I saw my colleague's project presentation, with a little help from my brother I,
  reviewed my code again and found:
    * a bug in my diagonal checking method ..
    * **TIE** method ..
  both were fixed ..

last but not least ..
here's the deployed link for my project ..
